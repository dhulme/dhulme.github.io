Windows does have some advantages over mac, mainly price and customisability, but it is definitely harder to get set up and working reliably. Hopefully in this article you&#39;ll find answers to common problems I have experienced.</p><h2 id="minimum-recommend-specs" tabindex="-1">Minimum Recommend Specs <a class="header-anchor" href="#minimum-recommend-specs" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Minimum Recommend Specs&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li>Windows 10 (Microsoft won&#39;t be updating 7 or 8 for much longer)</li><li>8GB RAM or more</li><li>256GB SSD or more (You can load samples from a hard disk or external drive if necessary)</li><li>Intel Core i5 (preferably i7)</li><li>External USB audio interface</li></ul><h2 id="troubleshooting" tabindex="-1">Troubleshooting <a class="header-anchor" href="#troubleshooting" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Troubleshooting&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="i-get-intermittent-freezes-in-ableton-or-midi-controllers-stop-working" tabindex="-1">I get intermittent freezes in ableton or midi controllers stop working. <a class="header-anchor" href="#i-get-intermittent-freezes-in-ableton-or-midi-controllers-stop-working" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;I get intermittent freezes in ableton or midi controllers stop working.&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Check USB cable length, I recommend 3m or less. If you&#39;re using a USB hub, make sure it&#39;s powered. Replace existing USB cables, sometimes a dodgy wire can cause dropouts. Are your USB connections lose? If so, use a screwdriver to pull the socket prongs out a bit to improve the connection.</p><p>Ensure Ableton and your Windows are up to date. Disable &#39;USB selective suspend setting&#39; under power plan settings. Check you have the correct drivers for your audio interface.</p><p>Sometimes there can be differences between using a USB 2 and USB 3 port. USB 3 ports are blue or have &#39;SS&#39; written with the USB logo. Try changing the type of USB port you are using.</p><h3 id="windows-restarts-whilst-i-m-on-stage" tabindex="-1">Windows restarts whilst i&#39;m on stage! <a class="header-anchor" href="#windows-restarts-whilst-i-m-on-stage" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Windows restarts whilst i&#39;m on stage!&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Set your &#39;active hours&#39; under Windows Update settings.</p><h3 id="i-get-pops-or-crackles-in-my-audio" tabindex="-1">I get &#39;pops&#39; or &#39;crackles&#39; in my audio! <a class="header-anchor" href="#i-get-pops-or-crackles-in-my-audio" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;I get &#39;pops&#39; or &#39;crackles&#39; in my audio!&quot;">​</a></h3><p>On low performance machines this could be due to your audio buffer size, try increasing it. Most likely however it is a driver issue. Ensure you have the latest drivers from the audio interface manufacturer for your operating system. If these don&#39;t work, contact your audio interface manufacturer, they should be able to provide advice and support. I have had driver problems with Focusrite Scarlett interfaces on Windows 10 machines, but after some driver tweaking everything works reliably.</p><h3 id="sometimes-when-playing-tracks-or-virtual-instruments-i-get-audio-glitches-and-ableton-freezes-briefly" tabindex="-1">Sometimes when playing tracks or virtual instruments, I get audio glitches and ableton freezes briefly. <a class="header-anchor" href="#sometimes-when-playing-tracks-or-virtual-instruments-i-get-audio-glitches-and-ableton-freezes-briefly" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sometimes when playing tracks or virtual instruments, I get audio glitches and ableton freezes briefly.&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This is most likely disk problems.
